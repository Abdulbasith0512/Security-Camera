## Usage

### Home Page

The home page displays the live camera feed and system status. Recent motion alerts are shown on the right side.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all motion events with timestamps and images. You can filter events by date and switch between grid, list, and timeline views.

### Settings

The settings page allows you to configure:

- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Camera settings
- Motion detection parameters

## Security Considerations

- This application is designed for local network use
- If exposing to the internet, implement proper authentication
- Store sensitive credentials securely (consider using environment variables)
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues

- Ensure your webcam is properly connected
- Check if other applications are using the camera
- Try changing the camera source in settings

### Email Notification Issues

- Verify SMTP server and port are correct
- For Gmail, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" or use an App Password
- Check your firewall settings

### SMS Notification Issues

- Verify your Twilio credentials are correct
- Ensure your Twilio account is active and funded
- Check that the phone number format includes country code
